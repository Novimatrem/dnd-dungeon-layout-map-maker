# dnd-dungeon-layout-map-maker

Launch the launch-fedora.sh shell script to run.
If you don't use Fedora, it will probably still work if you go inside of the script, replace all instances of 'dnf' with the name of your package manager, and run the shell script.

Yes, I know, the code is awful, the way you have to launch it is awful, and it's not fast to use. But it works. This is my first ever proper Python project that actually does anything other than error-out. I do intend to make something better in the future, or to improve this version, but for now, this literally *does* do the job. No matter how inefficiently.
